Just copy the two mount/umount scripts to your /vz/private/<CTID>/scripts/
directory. If you're still using Virtuozzo 3 copy them to
/etc/sysconfig/vz-scripts/<CTID>.mount and
/etc/sysconfig/vz-scripts/<CTID>.umount. Though I strongly suggest to
upgrade to Virtuozzo 4 and vzctl convert <CTID>. The reason for this is
that while VZ3 only migrates it's mount script, VZ4 will migrate the
whole 'scripts' directory. So with VZ4 it is much easier to maintain an
external config file.

After that you should create your own config file
/vz/private/<CTID>/scripts/vzhaipd.conf
where you define all variables according to your local requirements

Get further documentation by doing a simple 'perldoc mount' or
take a look at the prepared files in the documentation/ directory
